/**
 * A process-wide pool of live xterm terminals, one per ptyId.
 *
 * Why: node-pty keeps no scrollback. If we created/disposed an xterm every time
 * the user switched agents (or toggled fullscreen), the new terminal would be
 * empty and stay blank until the TUI happened to repaint — which is exactly the
 * "terminal vanishes until I drag the splitter" bug.
 *
 * Instead each pty gets ONE Terminal for the app's lifetime. It is opened into a
 * detached host <div> and subscribes to the pty stream once, so its buffer is
 * always populated. A view (the sidebar tab or the fullscreen overlay) simply
 * re-parents that host element into itself when it mounts and detaches it on
 * unmount — the rendered content moves with it, so the terminal is always
 * visible immediately, no repaint required.
